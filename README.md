# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi Extensions Revived

This repository contains several source extensions that have been removed from the official repository.

I'll probably keep maintaining the MangaDex extension here and push fixes if it breaks at some point in future.

Other sources are likely not going to be maintained actively and are stored here for archival purposes instead. Feel free to send pull requests for those, though.

This repo is a flattened & detached fork because the git history of the upstream repo is over 400 megabytes big.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tachiyomi does not enable unofficial extension apps by default.
> **You must manually press the 'TRUST' button** after installing the extension on Tachiyomi's extension management screen!

Google Play Protect may show a warning screen mentioning that the app is published by an unknown developer. This is because I had to use my own freshly created signing key that is not yet recognized by Google. 

## Downloads

### Add this repo to Tachiyomi (v0.15.0+)

Starting with Tachiyomi version v0.15.0 and later, you can add external extension repos!

1. Update to the latest version of Tachiyomi
2. Go to Settings > Browse > Extension repos > Add
3. Enter the following URL and accept: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePBone/tachiyomi-extensions-revived/repo/index.min.json`
4. Go to the extension management screen, refresh it, and you can now download the removed extensions.

### Direct APK downloads
You can also directly download the APK files in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/ThePBone/tachiyomi-extensions-revived/tree/repo/apk).

After installing any unofficial extension, you must **manually** enable the extension in Tachiyomi.
