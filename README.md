# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi Extensions Revived

This repository contains several source extensions that have been removed from the official repository.

I'll probably keep maintaining the MangaDex extension here and push fixes if it breaks at some point in future.

Other sources are likely not going to be maintained actively and are stored here for archival purposes instead. Feel free to send pull requests for those, though.

This repo is a flattened & detached fork because the git history of the upstream repo is over 400 megabytes big.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tachiyomi does not enable unofficial extension apps by default.
> **You must manually press the 'TRUST' button** after installing the extension on Tachiyomi's extension management screen!

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/ or directly in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/ThePBone/tachiyomi-extensions-revived/tree/repo/apk).

After installing any unofficial extension, you must **manually** enable the extension in Tachiyomi.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're migrating from an old official extension to one from this repo, you need to uninstall the old extension by hand first. This is due to an app signature conflict since I have to use my own signing keys.
